1. **Bot Ownership**: You must be the owner of the bot and have access to its application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. **Server Count**: Your bot must be in at least **75 servers**. Discord uses this metric to determine if your bot is widely used.
3. **Privacy Policy**: Your bot must have a publicly accessible Privacy Policy that explains how user data is collected, stored, and used.
4. **Terms of Service**: Provide a Terms of Service document that outlines the rules and guidelines for using your bot.

6. **No Violations**: Your bot must not violate any of Discord's policies, including but not limited to gambling, scams, or harmful content.
